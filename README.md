# Tweeter Project

**Tweeter** is a simple, single-page social media platform! Chronologically read through your personally curated list of tweets. **Tweeter** keeps it simple, with the push of one button you can share your thoughts to people around the world. Don't like to share your thoughts? That ok! You can like and share other peoples. Enjoy this simple social media platform on your phone, tablet or desktop today!

**V2.0** Now with two more buttons! We heard you like buttons so we added two more. 'Write a tweet' and a 'scroll back to top'.
